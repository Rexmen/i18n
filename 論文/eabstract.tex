Nowadays a web page may have versions in multiple languages. This thesis extends the thesis “Internationalization Support for Automated Web Testing with Robot Framework" by Chun-Ping Chu, which supports only seven Robot Framework native keywords and is limited to three HTML attributes as translation targets. In addition to supporting more keywords and HTML attributes, the extension in this thesis also supports user’s choice of translations of words and  installation by pip.
